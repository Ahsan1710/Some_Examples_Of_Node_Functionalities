# Modules Creation And Usage Example In Node

In these examples you can see how to create a module in **_Node_** and how to import and export these modules in different ways.
There are three different self made modules examples and one orignal node module example:

- **_Common JS Modules_**
- **_ECMAScript Modules_**
- **_Separate Internals And Use Them In A Main Module_**
- **_Http_Example (Orignal Node Module)_**

## 1. Common JS Modules

In this example, it has been shown that how in different ways you can export a self made Common JS module and how you can use it in other Common JS modules or your main JS code file.

## 2. ECMAScript Modules

In this example, it has been shown that how in different ways you can export a self made ECMAScript module and how you can use it in other ECMAScript modules or your main ECMAScript code file.

## 3. Separate Internals And Use Them In A Main Module

In this example, it has been shown that how you combine different Internals of a main Module and import and export them combined in the main module.

## 4. Http_Example.js (Orignal Node Module)

This is an orignal node module **'HTTP'** example, in which it has been shown that how we can use built in node modules in our code.
